Known Issue #191771:
  'Node' panes can have two titles or have two title areas.
  Cause: 
    Content that comes into a pane is already formatted, and this happens
    in theme('node'). theme('node') assumes it will be printing a title
    most of the time. However, Panels wants the titles of panes to be
    consistent, so it removes the title from the node to prevent your
    node.tpl.php from printing it. The result is often an empty h2 which
    has odd effects.
  Solution:
    Add an if statement to your node.tpl.php to prevent printing that h2
    if $node->title is empty.

Known Issue #186454:
  Internet Explorer is really bad about making the rightmost panel
  fall beneath the others.
  Cause:
    Internet explorer calculates margins and padding differntly from
    everyone else, and this makes it entirely too easy for widths
    to add up to greater than the amount of allotted space, despite
    using percentage widths.
  Solution:
    There are two solutions to this problem:
    1) In your theme, try to eliminate padding from the the <div>
       that directly contains your content; you can do this by
       adding an empty <div> inside it that surrounds the content
       and very specifically is set to margin: 0 and padding: 0

    2) if that doesn't work, override the widths of the panel-panel
       divs and reduce them by 1 or 2%; usually this will give IE
       enough space to quit pushing things around.
