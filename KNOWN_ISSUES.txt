Known Issue #191771:
  'Node' panes can have two titles or have two title areas.
  Cause: 
    Content that comes into a pane is already formatted, and this happens
    in theme('node'). theme('node') assumes it will be printing a title
    most of the time. However, Panels wants the titles of panes to be
    consistent, so it removes the title from the node to prevent your
    node.tpl.php from printing it. The result is often an empty h2 which
    has odd effects.
  Solution:
    Add an if statement to your node.tpl.php to prevent printing that h2
    if $node->title is empty.
